Another love just slipped away It's hard to tell you when I haven't all this time Maybe if I wear it on my face Someone else will let you know I'm not alright
With nothing to lose But all this to drink I'm drowning in you I can't help but think What if? What if I didn't know That letting you let me go
Would leave me here all alone Missing you? And what if I didn't run The second our second chance wasn't gone? What if you were the one? What if I wasn't done loving you?
I wonder if you ever feel the same Intimidated by thе way you seemed just fine I know I told you it'd be bеtter this way I didn't know that it would it hurt me like that Should've known that it'd be hard to go back
With nothing to lose But all this to drink I'm drowning in you I can't help but think What if? What if I didn't know That letting you let me go Would leave me here all alone (leave me here all alone)
Missing you? And what if I didn't run (I didn't run) The second our second chance wasn't gone (wasn't gone) What if you were the one? What if I wasn't done loving you?
Loving you Loving you What if I wasn't done loving you? Loving you Loving you What if I wasn't done loving you? What if I wasn't done loving you? What if I wasn't done loving you?
And maybe I should have known That letting you let me go Would leave me here all alone Missing you And what if I didn't run The second our second chance wasn't gone? What if you were the one?
