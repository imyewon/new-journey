        <h4>This incredible song is one of my favorite one. I hope everyone enjoy it.</h4>

            You made a friend, somebody said
            They saw you leave with him tonight
            I'd hate to think you'd bite his lip
            The way you did when you were mine
            Oh-ooh, maybe I have one too many now
            But it's getting late, and you're on my side of town
            If you're falling apart
            You can't see through the dark
            I will leave the light on
            I will leave the light on
            It's 3 a.m. and you can't find your friends (can't find your friends)
            I will leave the light on if you wanna come home
            I will leave the light on for you
            You were the first, that's why it hurts
            My heart, it burns, but I'll be fine
            Some part of me has to believe
            Eventually, you'll change your mind
            Oh-ooh, maybe I had one too many now
            (Maybe I've had one too many now)
            But I ain't sleeping next to the one I dream about
            If you're falling apart
            You can't see through the dark (you can't see through the dark)
            I will leave the light on
            I will leave the light on
            It's 3 a.m. and you can't find your friends (can't find your friends)
            I will leave the light on if you wanna come home
            Baby, when you find someone, I hope he deserves you
            Baby, when you love someone, if he ever hurts you
            I will leave the light on for you
            I will leave the light on
            Ooh-ooh, aha-ah, ah, oh-ooh
            Maybe I had one too many now
            But I ain't sleeping next to the one I dream about
            If you're falling apart
            You can't see through the dark (you can't see through the dark)
            I will leave the light on
            I will leave the light on
            It's 3 a.m. and you can't find your friends
            I will leave the light on if you wanna come home
            Baby, when you find someone, I hope he deserves you
            Baby, when you love someone, if he ever hurts you
            I will leave the light on for you
            I will leave the light on
            Ooh-ooh, aha-ah, ah
