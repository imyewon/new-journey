<h2>Let me down easy by Why don't we</h2>
<p><img src = "lonely.jpg" width="100%">
    I know sometimes you get pissed off
    I know you can't stand it when
    I cancel plans, I brushed you off
    Yeah, we never planned it, yeah
    I know sometimes that I fuck up
    And when I think I don't, I need your love (yeah)
    If you wake up one day and don't feel the same
    Would you still smile when the feeling fades?
    Look to the side when I'm saying your name
    Say it's all fine, baby, lie to my face
    Who am I to make you stay?
    Baby, let me down easy
    If you wake up one day and don't feel the same
    Will you? Will you?
    La-la-la, la-la-la-la-la
    Will you let me down easy?
    La-la-la, la-la-la-la-la
    Will you? Will you?
    La-la-la, la-la-la-la-la
    Will you let me down easy?
    La-la-la, la-la-la-la-la
    Will you? Will you?
    Say shit, say shit we don't mean at all
    Don't pay attention when they're not involved
    Complications, they can't be solved
    If you walk away then we might lose it all
    When you walked into my life, I'm feeling different now
    And when we wake up, I say, "Quick, let's switch positions now"
    And your friends, they got opinions but they getting loud
    But you know you mean the most, don't start actin' different now
    If you wake up one day and don't feel the same
    Would you still smile when the feeling fades?
    Look to the side when I'm saying your name
    Say it's all fine, baby, lie to my face
    Who am I to make you stay?
    Baby, let me down easy
    If you wake up one day and don't feel the same
    Will you? Will you?
    La-la-la, la-la-la-la-la
    Will you let me down easy?
    La-la-la, la-la-la-la-la
    Will you? Will you?
    La-la-la, la-la-la-la-la
    Will you let me down easy?
    La-la-la, la-la-la-la-la
    Will you? Will you?
    If you wake up one day and don't feel the same
    Would you still smile when the feeling fades?
    Look to the side when I'm saying your name
    Say it's all fine, baby, lie to my face
    Who am I to make you stay?
    Baby, let me down easy
    If you wake up one day and don't feel the same
    Will you? Will you?
