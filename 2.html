<h2>Anti-Hero by Taylor Swift</h2>
    <p><img src = "taylor.jpg" width="100%">
        I have this thing where I get older but just never wiser
        Midnights become my afternoons
        When my depression works the graveyard shift
        All of the people I've ghosted stand there in the room
        I should not be left to my own devices
        They come with prices and vices
        I end up in crisis (tale as old as time)
        I wake up screaming from dreaming
        One day I'll watch as you're leaving
        'Cause you got tired of my scheming
        (For the last time)
        It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me
        At tea time, everybody agrees
        I'll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror
        It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero
        Sometimes I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
        And I'm a monster on the hill
        Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city
        Pierced through the heart, but never killed
        Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism
        Like some kind of congressman? (Tale as old as time)
        I wake up screaming from dreaming
        One day I'll watch as you're leaving
        And life will lose all its meaning
        (For the last time)
        It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)
        At tea time, everybody agrees
        I'll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror
        It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero
        I have this dream my daughter in-law kills me for the money
        She thinks I left them in the will
        The family gathers 'round and reads it and then someone screams out
        "She's laughing up at us from hell"
        It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me
        It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me
        It's me, hi, everybody agrees, everybody agrees
        It's me, hi (hi), I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)
        At tea (tea) time (time), everybody agrees (everybody agrees)
        I'll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror
        It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero
