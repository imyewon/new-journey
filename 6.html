<h2>Anything for you by Lany</h2>
<p>
    <br>I know the house you grew up in
    All of the names of your best friends
    I know the way you feel about your dad
    I spent the summer on your couch
    You fell in love with someone else
    You came to me the times that it went bad
    I'm something so familiar
    That you don't even notice
    The way I wanna love ya
    It's time that you should know this, know this
    I'll catch a flight, go to the moon
    Lay on the floor of your livin' room
    And talk about the things that make you cry (cry)
    I'll sell my soul, sell my guitar
    Sleep in the back of a beat up car
    Girl, just tell me what I have to do
    I'll do anything for you
    You know the house we grew up in
    You wouldn't knock, you'd just walk in
    Stay up for hours talkin' to my mom
    I'm something so familiar
    That you don't even notice
    The way I wanna love ya
    It's time that you should know this, know this
    I'll catch a flight, go to the moon
    Lay on the floor of your livin' room
    And talk about the things that make you cry (cry)
    I'll sell my soul, sell my guitar
    Sleep in the back of a beat up car
    Girl, just tell me what I have to do
    If you say, "I wanna leave this town tonight"
    Then let's do it
    If we're halfway there and then you change your mind
    There's nothing to it
    If it takes the rest of my whole life
    To prove it
    I'll catch a flight, go to the moon
    Lay on the floor of your livin' room
    And talk about the things that make you cry (cry)
    I'll never walk into another bar
    I'll burn these tattoos off my arms
    I'll go to hell and back if I have to
    I'll do anything for you
    I'll do anything for you
    I'll do anything for you
