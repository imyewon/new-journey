<h2>Ipad by The Chainsmokers</h2>
<p>
    I go through your iPad looking for
    Somethin' that I used to have
    Guess I finally lost my mind (lost my mind)
    I wish that I could take my number back
    Go back to the place we met
    Start this up a second time (second time)
    You're living in a past life, twenty-five
    All your friends are verified
    Acting like they're first in line
    I'm lookin' at your life through cellophane
    Hoping things would stay the same
    I was always by your side
    And isn't it strange how we're strangers again?
    Isn't it strange how we're strangers again?
    Yeah, now we're strangers again
    Yeah, now we're strangers again
    You were just a downtown socialite
    Ship I pass on summer nights
    Shadow that I can't define
    Turned into a gaslight kerosene
    Love that felt like seventeen
    Hurt me 'til I feel alive
    I wonder who your friends are
    Where you go, who you know now
    You play the same card, swear to God
    Do you call him?
    Isn't it strange how we're strangers again?
    Yeah, now we're strangers again
    Yeah, now we're strangers again
    You were just a downtown socialite
    Ship I pass on summer nights
    Shadow that I can't define
    Turned into a gaslight kerosene
    Love that felt like seventeen
    Hurt me 'til I feel alive
    Isn't it strange how we're strangers again?
    Now both of us know we were better as friends
    When it all, yeah, when it all falls apart
    Sometimes you let go just to know where to start
    Somethin' that I used to have
    Somethin' that I used to have
    Somethin' that I used to have
    Yeah, now we're strangers again
    Somethin' that I used to have
    You were just a downtown socialite
    Ship I pass on summer nights
    Shadow that I can't define
    Turned into a gaslight kerosene
    Love that felt like seventeen
    Hurt me 'til I feel alive
